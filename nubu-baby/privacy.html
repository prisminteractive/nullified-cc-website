<h1>Privacy Policy for Nubu Baby</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 15, 2025<br />
<strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 25, 2025</p>
<p>Humando AB ("Humando", "we", "our", or "us") operates the Nubu Baby: Feed · Sleep · Track mobile application, related websites, and support channels (the "Services"). This notice explains how we handle personal information. Nubu Baby is a caregiver journaling tool only; it does not provide medical advice. By using the Services you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>1. Who We Are &amp; How To Reach Us</h2>

</ul>
<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect only what we need to run the Services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account &amp; Subscription Data:</strong> Email, password hash, StoreKit purchase confirmations, Apple ID region.</li>
<li><strong>Baby Journals:</strong> Baby names or nicknames, birth dates, logged events (feeding, diaper, sleep, growth, notes), caregiver invites, optional attachment metadata.</li>

</ul>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect precise geolocation, advertising identifiers, or payment card data.</p>
<h2>3. Why We Use This Information</h2>
<p>We use personal information to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide, secure, and troubleshoot the Services, including sync, backups, and caregiver sharing (contract performance).</li>
<li>Process subscriptions via Apple and enforce free-tier limits (contract performance &amp; legitimate interest).</li>
<li>Respond to support or safety requests and comply with legal obligations.</li>
<li>Improve stability and plan features through aggregated diagnostics (legitimate interest, only when analytics are enabled with your consent).</li>
</ol>
<p>We never sell data or use it for targeted advertising.</p>
<h2>4. Sharing &amp; Transfers</h2>
<p>We share data only with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Storage (Google Cloud, primarily U.S. regions) for sync/backups; email delivery partners for exports/support; secure logging and monitoring vendors. These providers act under contract and may process data outside the EU/UK using Standard Contractual Clauses.</li>
<li><strong>Caregivers You Authorize:</strong> People you invite can view the shared baby data until access is revoked.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Authorities:</strong> When required by law or to protect safety. We review each request for validity.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not permit third-party tracking scripts or advertising SDKs.</p>
<h2>5. Retention &amp; Security</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free Tier:</strong> Event history older than 3 rolling days is deleted automatically from our systems.</li>
<li><strong>Premium/Trial:</strong> Data is retained while your account is active; after cancellation we keep it up to 30 days before deletion or irreversible anonymization.</li>
<li><strong>Backups/Exports:</strong> Expire within 30 days unless you delete them sooner.</li>
<li><strong>Support Records &amp; Audit Logs:</strong> Retained up to 24 months for compliance and security.</li>
</ul>
<p>We protect data with TLS encryption in transit, encrypted storage, role-based access controls, and monitored audit logging. No security program is perfect—use device passcodes and contact us if you suspect unauthorized access.</p>
<h2>6. Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Manage analytics, caregivers, exports, and deletions directly in-app.</li>
<li>Request access, correction, deletion, restriction, or portability by emailing nubu_baby_privacy@nullified.cc from your account email. We verify identity before fulfilling requests.</li>
<li>EEA/UK residents may object to processing based on legitimate interests, withdraw consent, or lodge a complaint with the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) or your local regulator.</li>
<li>California and other U.S. state residents may request disclosure, correction, or deletion of personal information. We do not sell or share personal information for cross-context advertising.</li>
